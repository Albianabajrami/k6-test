## Performance, Load and Stress testing with k6
This project demonstrates the use of `k6` to perform performance, load, and stress testing on a TypeScript-based application. The purpose is to simulate different traffic patterns and assess the application's stability and performance under various conditions. 

## Testing Overview

In this project, we performed three types of tests using `k6`:

### 1. **Performance Testing**
   - Performance testing is designed to determine how the system behaves under normal conditions and within expected user traffic.
   - We simulated various numbers of virtual users (VUs) to measure response times and the systemâ€™s overall responsiveness.

### 2. **Load Testing**
   - Load testing simulates increasing traffic to ensure that the application can handle the expected number of users and their requests.
   - We ran tests with gradually increasing VUs to understand how the system handles heavier loads over time.

### 3. **Stress Testing**
   - Stress testing is used to push the system beyond its limits by simulating an extreme number of users.
   - The purpose of this test is to determine the breaking point of the system, identify bottlenecks, and assess how the system recovers from failure conditions.


## Installation instructions
- **Node.js** (version: latest)
- **TypeScript**
- **Docker** (for running `k6` tests in a container)
- **k6** installed or using Docker (`grafana/k6`)

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Albianabajrami/BookReviewTest.git
   cd k6-test
   
## How to run tests indivitually?
The general command to run the tests is:

docker run --rm -v [Your path]/k6-test/build:/app -i grafana/k6 run /app/[Type of the test].js --env GROUP=[Name of the group] --env ENDPOINT=[Endpoint method]

### **Test scenatious and results**

Below are included some examples of test cases and results.

- Test type: Performance

- Group: bookReviews
- Command: docker run --rm -v C:/Users/Albiana/Desktop/k6-test/build:/app -i grafana/k6 run /app/performance-test.js --env GROUP=bookReviews --env ENDPOINT=post
